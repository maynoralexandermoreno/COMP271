# COMP271-BrookdaleCC
Brookdale Community College, Fall 2017, COMP 271 Java 2

Hello,

These are all labs using Indroduction to Java Programming, 10th edition, by Y. Daniel Lang. The questions, along with some hints, are included in the comments before the solution program. Labs are located in the src folder.

This semester covers chapters 10-17; 32.

Topics include Classes, Objects, Object-Oriented Programming, Inheritance & Polymorphism, Exception Handling & I/O, GUI, Event Programming, Binary I/O, & Accessing a Relational Database 

SUGGESTIONS: Do yourself a solid and read the textbook. It is well written and comprehensive. If you have an error and cannot contact your instructor, the textbook probably has the solution in the corresponding chapter(s). Do your best to understand what the basic rules are. Understanding the rules fully will help you write code quickly when time is a constraint. Do not cheat. These are exersises you should be able to do solo. Hints were provided before the solutions so as to encourage you to code it yourself. Classes will only get harder from here, and you will become lost if you cheat. As well, cheating detection software is quite powerful, and you will jeopardize your academic and professional future. With weak roots and tainted soil, a tree will only bear rotten fruit.

Many thanks to Instructor S. Vincent Chang.
