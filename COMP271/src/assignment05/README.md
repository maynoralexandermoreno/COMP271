*14.3 (Display three cards) Write a program that displays three cards randomly
selected from a deck of 52, as shown in Figure 14.43c. The card image files
are named 1.png, 2.png, …, 52.png and stored in the image/card directory.
All three cards are distinct and selected randomly. Hint: You can select random
cards by storing the numbers 1–52 to an array list, perform a random shuffle
introduced in Section 11.12, and use the first three numbers in the array list as
the file names for the image.

 Note: Image files (image.zip) can be found in the file link
