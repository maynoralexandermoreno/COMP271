Create a user friendly interface to order a pizza. 
Use appropriate controls (radio buttons, list boxes, check boxes) to obtain the type of pizza (e.g. small, medium, large) and the toppings. 
Calculate the cost of the pizza based upon the size, number of toppings and delivery charge. 
Display a summary of the order in a text area along with the total cost.
Provide buttons which places the order and clears the order. 
One option is to reuse the pizza object that was created in class during unit 1 and 2.
